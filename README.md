This is a fork from below.
The purpose is to prevent disasters with vision algoritms.
Current changes is to utilize latest c++ and opencv 3.4.3 and above.
This upgrade will keep going with feedback from public, if any.

                                VISION-BASED FIRE DETECTION USING VIDEO SEQUENCES

Abstract

Fire, if improperly used, could pose great threats to peoples’ security, life, and property. Motivated by the requirement to detect fire at its early stage, we aimed to develop an automatic system for vision-based fire detection using video sequences. Our system included four major steps, namely image preprocessing, foreground region analysis, fire dynamic behavior analysis, and fire flow energy analysis. Overall, our system could achieve the detection rates of over 91% in either indoor or outdoor environments. In addition, our system could achieve the system response time within 1 second (average delay of ~25 frames) once the fire occurred. In summary, our system could be used in surveillance systems, leading to prevent damage to peoples’ security, life, and property.

System software environment

CMake with latest c++ compiler including llvm, visual stuio etc.
OpenCV latest , tested under 3.4.3
boost test , optional
