The purpose of this project is to prevent disasters with AI technologies.

But before applying AI technology, I need a solid baseline to be a good starting point. The paper and codes from TCHsieh is great enough.

To use this,
- CMake latest version
- C++ compiler. currently I am testing on llvm 7 , apple latest clang,and MS visual studio 2017 15.9XX
- opencv 3.4.3 or higher is recommended
- boost test is optional

Please refer below paper for the science behind.
And this is still under heavy POC stage. if you needs some help, let me know with below email

              VISION-BASED FIRE DETECTION USING VIDEO SEQUENCES

Abstract

Fire, if improperly used, could pose great threats to peoples’ security, life, and property. Motivated by the requirement to detect fire at its early stage, we aimed to develop an automatic system for vision-based fire detection using video sequences. Our system included four major steps, namely image preprocessing, foreground region analysis, fire dynamic behavior analysis, and fire flow energy analysis. Overall, our system could achieve the detection rates of over 91% in either indoor or outdoor environments. In addition, our system could achieve the system response time within 1 second (average delay of ~25 frames) once the fire occurred. In summary, our system could be used in surveillance systems, leading to prevent damage to peoples’ security, life, and property.
